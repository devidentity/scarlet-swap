**Core Features (Free):**

* **Basic Rule Editing:** Modify the 'Find', 'Replace', and 'Description' fields of the default rules.
* **Enable/Disable Rules:** Easily toggle individual default rules on or off via the Options page.
* **Global Toggle:** Quickly enable or disable all replacements using the extension popup.
* **Themed Interface:** A clean UI with Buckeye colors.

**Premium Features (Unlockable):**

* ✨ **Add Custom Rules:** Create unlimited new text replacement rules.
* 🗑️ **Remove Rules:** Delete custom rules you no longer need.
* ↕️ **Reorder Rules:** Drag and drop rules to control the order replacements happen (useful for overlapping rules).
* ⚙️ **Advanced Matching:**
    * Use **Regular Expressions (RegEx)** for powerful pattern matching.
    * Control **Case Sensitivity**.
    * Match **Whole Words** only.
* 🎨 **Custom Styling:** Apply custom CSS styles (like color, bolding) to your replaced text.
* 🌐 **Domain Filtering:**
    * **Per-Rule Filters:** Make rules run only on specific websites (Allowlist) or exclude specific websites (Blocklist).
    * **Global Filters:** Set default Allow/Block lists that apply to all rules inheriting the global setting.
* 💾 **Import/Export:** Back up your rules to a JSON file or import rules shared by others.
